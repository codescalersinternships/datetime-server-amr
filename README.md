# Datetime Server

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic HTTP server in Go that returns the current date and time. The server is implemented using net/http library and Gin frameworks and containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Installation

```
Access the (net/http) server endpoint:

```
Access the Gin server endpoint:
